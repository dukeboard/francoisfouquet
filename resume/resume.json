    "summary": "Since my PhD, my research objectives are targeting the software engineering methods to build distributed, large-scale smart systems. As a framework design, my prototypes try to represent the backbone data layer to empower reasoning engine for Smart Systems. Since two years now, my research is now focused on the construction of time-aware systems, leveraging innovative solutions to represent temporal data using physics quantum theory to better distributed massive models. I’m mainly applying this the construction of SmartGrid systems, able for instance, to detect or predict suspicious or overload values. Towards Intelligent systems, I’m working to include the use of machine learning directly into these data structure in order create synergies between Big Data, forecasting systems and simulation mechanisms.",
